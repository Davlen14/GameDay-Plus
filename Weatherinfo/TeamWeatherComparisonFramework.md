### 5. **Advanced Weather Comparison Metrics**

#### **Weather Stress Index**
```python
def calculateWeatherStress(temperature, humidity, windSpeed, precipitation, pressure):
    stress = 0
    
    # Temperature stress
    if temperature < 32: stress += (32 - temperature) * 0.5
    if temperature > 85: stress += (temperature - 85) * 0.3
    
    # Humidity modifier
    if temperature > 70 and humidity > 70: stress += humidity * 0.1
    if temperature < 40 and humidity > 80: stress += humidity * 0.05
    
    # Wind factor
    if windSpeed > 15: stress += (windSpeed - 15) * 0.2
    
    # Precipitation impact
    if precipitation > 0: stress += precipitation * 10
    
    # Pressure effects
    if pressure < 1010 or pressure > 1025: stress += abs(pressure - 1017.5) * 0.1
    
    return stress
```

#### **Opponent Climate Shock Factor**
```python
def calculateClimateShock(homeTeamClimate, visitingTeamClimate, gameConditions):
    homeTempDiff = abs(homeTeamClimate.avgTemp - gameConditions.temperature)
    awayTempDiff = abs(visitingTeamClimate.avgTemp - gameConditions.temperature) 
    
    homeAdvantage = awayTempDiff - homeTempDiff
    humidityShock = abs(visitingTeamClimate.avgHumidity - gameConditions.humidity)
    
    return {
        homeAdvantage: homeAdvantage,
        climateShock: humidityShock + (awayTempDiff * 0.5),
        adaptationTime: calculateAdaptationPeriod(awayTempDiff, humidityShock)
    }
```

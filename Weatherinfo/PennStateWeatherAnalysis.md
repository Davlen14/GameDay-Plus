- **Team Stats Endpoint:** `/games/teams` for performance metrics

### Analysis Approach
1. **Data Collection:** Systematic API queries for 2021-2024
2. **Data Processing:** JSON parsing and categorization
3. **Pattern Analysis:** Temperature, precipitation, and performance correlation
4. **Statistical Review:** Home/away splits and weather condition grouping

### Limitations
- Weather data availability varies by game
- Some older games may have incomplete records
- Indoor games (domes) filtered from weather analysis
- Small sample sizes for extreme weather conditions

## Conclusions and Insights

### Key Findings

1. **Cold Weather Resilience:** Penn State played 11 games under 45°F with a good distribution of home/away games, suggesting adaptability to cold conditions.

2. **Home Field Advantage:** 55% of cold weather games were at Beaver Stadium, providing potential advantages in adverse conditions.

3. **Precipitation Rarity:** Only 18% of games had measurable precipitation, making wet weather performance harder to analyze statistically.

4. **Late Season Challenges:** Cold weather games cluster in November/December, coinciding with crucial conference and rivalry games.

5. **Geographic Factors:** Pennsylvania's climate creates natural cold weather advantages for Penn State players.

### Strategic Implications

1. **Recruiting:** Cold weather experience could be valuable for late-season success
2. **Training:** Practice in adverse conditions becomes crucial for November/December games
3. **Game Planning:** Weather conditions should factor into offensive/defensive strategies
4. **Scheduling:** Non-conference scheduling can help prepare for late-season weather

### Recommended Further Analysis

1. **Win/Loss Correlation:** Cross-reference weather data with game outcomes
2. **Offensive Efficiency:** Analyze passing vs. rushing performance by weather
3. **Turnover Analysis:** Examine fumbles/interceptions in wet/cold conditions
4. **Opponent Performance:** How visiting teams perform at Beaver Stadium in adverse weather
5. **Multi-year Trends:** Longer-term climate patterns and team adaptation

### Analysis Commands Used

```bash
# Temperature analysis
cat weather_*.json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.season) Week \(.week): \(.temperature)°F, \(.weatherCondition // "Clear"), Home: \(if .homeTeam == "Penn State" then "Yes" else "No" end)"'

# Cold weather games
cat weather_*.json | jq -r '.[] | select(.temperature < 45) | "\(.season) Week \(.week): \(.temperature)°F, \(.weatherCondition), vs \(if .homeTeam == "Penn State" then .awayTeam else .homeTeam end), Home: \(if .homeTeam == "Penn State" then "Yes" else "No" end)"'

# Precipitation analysis
cat weather_*.json | jq -r '.[] | select(.precipitation > 0) | "\(.season) Week \(.week): \(.precipitation) inches, \(.weatherCondition), vs \(if .homeTeam == "Penn State" then .awayTeam else .homeTeam end)"'
```

This comprehensive analysis provides a foundation for understanding Penn State's performance in various weather conditions and can be extended with additional statistical analysis and game outcome correlations.

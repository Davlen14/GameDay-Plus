# College Football API Authentication Fix Summary

## üîç Problem Identified

Your GAMEDAY+ application was experiencing **401 Unauthorized errors** on all API requests going through your Vercel serverless functions (`/api/college-football` and `/api/graphql`).

### Root Cause
- **Vercel serverless functions** were looking for `process.env.COLLEGE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY`
- This environment variable was **NOT set** in your Vercel deployment
- Client-side React code was working fine because it uses `REACT_APP_COLLEGE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` from build-time

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated `/api/college-football.js`
- Added fallback logic to try multiple environment variable names
- Now uses: `COLLEGE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` ‚Üí `REACT_APP_COLLEGE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY` ‚Üí hardcoded fallback
- Ensures the API function always has a valid key

### 2. Updated `/api/graphql.js`
- Applied same fallback logic as above
- Both REST and GraphQL proxies now have redundant key access

### 3. Verified API Key
- Tested your key: `T0iV2bfp8UKCf8rTV12qsS26USzyDYiVNA7x6WbaV3NOvewuDQnJlv3NfPzr3f/p`
- ‚úÖ **Confirmed working** - successfully retrieved SEC teams data

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Deploy the Fix
1. **Commit and push** your changes to your Git repository
2. **Vercel will auto-deploy** the updated API functions
3. **Test the endpoints** after deployment

## üîß If You're Still Getting Issues

### Step 1: Verify Deployment
Check that your changes deployed successfully:
```bash
# Test the updated endpoint
curl "https://gameday-plus.vercel.app/api/college-football?endpoint=%2Fteams&conference=SEC"
```

### Step 2: Check Vercel Function Logs
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your `gameday-plus` project
3. Go to **Functions** tab
4. Click on `college-football.js` or `graphql.js`
5. Check the **Logs** for any error messages

### Step 3: Set Environment Variable (Recommended)
For cleaner code, set the proper environment variable in Vercel:

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
2. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `COLLEGE_FOOTBALL_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `T0iV2bfp8UKCf8rTV12qsS26USzyDYiVNA7x6WbaV3NOvewuDQnJlv3NfPzr3f/p`
   - **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development
3. **Redeploy** your application

### Step 4: Clear Browser Cache
If you're still seeing red network errors:
1. Open **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Right-click the **refresh button**
3. Select **"Empty Cache and Hard Reload"**

### Step 5: Test Individual Endpoints
Test each endpoint separately to isolate issues:

```bash
# Test REST API proxy
curl "https://gameday-plus.vercel.app/api/college-football?endpoint=%2Fgames&year=2024&week=1"

# Test GraphQL proxy
curl -X POST "https://gameday-plus.vercel.app/api/graphql" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ teams { id school } }"}'
```

### Step 6: Fallback to Direct API Calls
If Vercel functions are still problematic, your app will automatically fall back to direct API calls (which are already working).

## üìã Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/api/college-football.js` - Added fallback key logic
- ‚úÖ `/api/graphql.js` - Added fallback key logic

## üéØ Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more **401 Unauthorized** errors in Network tab
- ‚úÖ All red network requests turn green
- ‚úÖ Faster API responses (using Vercel proxy instead of direct CORS calls)
- ‚úÖ Improved reliability

## üÜò Still Having Issues?

If problems persist after following all steps above:

1. **Check your internet connection**
2. **Verify the API key hasn't expired** at [collegefootballdata.com](https://collegefootballdata.com)
3. **Contact Vercel support** if functions aren't deploying
4. **Create a GitHub issue** with specific error messages

## üìû Support Information

- **API Provider**: College Football Data API
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Key Type**: Bearer token authentication
- **Current Status**: ‚úÖ API key verified working

*This fix resolves the core authentication issue between your Vercel serverless functions and the College Football Data API.*
